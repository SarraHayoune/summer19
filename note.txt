He is everywhere, in the heavens and Earth
He makes the stars shine, yet he cannot be seen
he is noble, abundant, and fills the universe
he an lift you into the sky and bring you gently down
he can take many forms
he can help heat
he can helpp create
and he can helpdestroy


Prause be unto He.  Helium
